Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use the GNU AGPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

A crucial section of the AGPL requires that if you modify and run the program on a server to interact with users remotely, you must also make the modified source code available to those users.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

This License applies to any program or other work containing a notice placed by the copyright holder stating it may be distributed under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License. The "Program" refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law.
